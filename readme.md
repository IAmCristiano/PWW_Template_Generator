# PWW's template generator!

Made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. For personal use.

## How it works:

Write the caption, select an image file and click the confirm button to preview it.
Try not to make the caption too long. Usually, 3 lines max works fine.
If it's all good, download the image. You can use the button in the end of the page, if you want to.
